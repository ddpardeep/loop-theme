If you’re going to define misophonia, you can also mention that it is often linked to high intelligence. Something in your favor! Next, explain your misophonia triggers. This could range from the sound of marker on a whiteboard, to chewing noises at lunch. Don’t hold back: be up-front about what sets you off.
